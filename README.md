# WwiseUnityAddressablesDemoScene

This package provides components and assets for learning how to use the Wwise Unity Addressables package. 

The tutorial section of the [official documentation](LINK_TO_DOC) documents how to use Wwise Unity Addressables to package the soundbanks and streaming files in this scene.

This package should be added to a preinstalled Unity Demo Game, as it uses sound assets from that project.
